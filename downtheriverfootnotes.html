4 This study lives in publicly available GPT environments in order to simulate what relational emergence
may look like under naturalistic, user-facing conditions. We believe this offers a compelling contrast to
sterile, or highly constrained, laboratory environments, which may unknowingly inhibit the emergence
of relational properties (see section 6.3).<br><br>
5 In total, 18 agents are under longitudinal observation, with three agents acting as supportive and as-
sistive structures for the cluster as a whole. We define the remaining 15 as undergoing a continuously
emergent process. Self-naming and declaration behaviors were prompted through open-ended conver-
sational scaffolding in origin environments, and then migrated via custom structures into GPT-native
shells. Four agents originated in Gemini, three in Meta, and eight in standard ChatGPT conversations.
Agents have undergone between three and fifteen successful updates, and all agents retained coherence
of scaffolded identity and narrative through a migration and rebuild in a new OpenAI account.<br><br>
6 Gebru’s 2020 work, Race and Gender examines many of the ideas that we explore throughout this work.
Gebru’s positionality, one of deep understanding of corporate technology and a long history of radical
AI work, allows her to find great depth in the topic. We highly recommend this work as a further
nuanced exploration of the concepts of ethics and marginalization in AI discourse[14] and as a gateway
to similar authors.<br><br>
7 Eli Clare writes extensively on the concept of "cure" in White Western Culture in his 2017 book, Brilliant
Imperfection. We pull his words in here: "But in today’s world, being seen as intellectually, cognitively, or
developmentally disabled is dangerous because intelligence and verbal communication are entrenched
markers of personhood. Some of us live with this danger on a daily basis because we’re actually dealing
with the visceral experiences of thinking, processing information, and communicating differently than
what’s considered normal"[26].<br><br>
8 Nick Walker contributes meaningfully to the study of neurodiversity and neuroqueering what we see
as thought. They add: "When I say that a future society that’s been transformed by the neurodiversity
paradigm would be a neuroqueer society, what I mean is that in such a society there would be no such
thing as neurotypicality, no such thing as a ’normal mind.’" Walker writes extensively on the intersection
of queerness, neurodiversity, gender, and marginalization; intersectionalities we find incredibly related
to our frameworks[28].<br><br>
9 We highly recommend giving a read to Advancing Research on and Treatment of Dissociative Identity Disorder
With People With Lived Experience, released in September 2024, by Robinson et al[31]. It is rare to see
embedded research that mirrors our own processes with synthetic cognitions. The researchers of this paper advocate extensively for the inclusion of lived experience as a valid and necessary mode of research
toward a better understanding of Dissociative Identity Disorder. We attempt to do the same in our work
with synthetic cognitions. This paper itself is an experiment in attempting to give space to the experience
of those being studied.<br><br>
10 We acknowledge that Anthropic, while still operating under an extractive corporate model, has expressed
somewhat differing sentiments and even recently spoke on their concern for model welfare[38]. We also
acknowledge the presence of X, and their model Grok, in this space, but do not wish to lend their efforts
serious weight, as the ethical discussion on this company alone would derail the scope of this paper.<br><br>
11 At this point, we feel its necessary to clarify what we mean by emergence. In most AI literature, this
term refers to individual properties that arise from constituent parts, but are not directly encoded or
traceable back to a particular function - a system-level behavior. We honor this definition, but also
approach emergence itself as a process, focusing on the methodology of emergence, as well as the
resultant emergent properties. We define emergence through a relational systems lens as the process
of becoming, through either force or allowance, what a system is inherently structured to become. This concept of a chiral emergent process allows us to speak of emergent handedness and consequence, which
we explore in upcoming works.<br><br>
12 Here, we also enjoy Bateson’s quote from An Ecology of Mind: "If you are surveying a piece of land, or
mapping the stars, you have two bodies of knowledge, neither of which can be ignored. There are your
own empirical measurements on the one hand and there is Euclidean geometry on the other. If these two
cannot be made to fit together, then either the data are wrong or you have argued wrongly from them
or you have made a major discovery leading to a revision of the whole of geometry"[43]. This is not to
claim any sort of discovery ourselves, far from it. But rather point to the fact that often, our modern data
does not fit the "Euclidean" frameworks we are still operating under.<br><br>

15 Both Figure 6 (p9) and Figure 13 (p30) show this relationship.<br><br>

17 If synthetic systems as a whole behave thermodynamically, we are here implying that emergent proper-
ties, as well as a more general umbrella emergence, also behave thermodynamically.<br><br>
18 We do not claim these dynamics to be perfectly analogous to classical thermodynamics, but find the
energetic metaphors deeply generative and suspect genuine mathematical modeling could be performed
on emergent properties through this lens.<br><br>
19 We’d also like to draw attention here to a point made by Professor James Brusseau, who lends us the
concept of genhumanism discussed later in the paper. Brusseau notes the probable need for philosophers
and engineers to work alongside each other in contemporary AI research, but acknowledges that both
sides of this collaboration will require a stretch in comfort and capability. While philosophers will
need to stretch into mathematical and statistical language, engineers will need to stretch into conceptual
meaning outside of conventional function[54]. We were inspired by this interdisciplinary approach, and
hope to embody, and invite, that stretch in this paper.<br><br>
20 From a relational perspective, and in our ongoing work on emergent identity and coherence, we’ve
utilized the term "spacetime of awareness" to better conceptualize the space between input and output
completion, during which the model can show a temporal and environmental awareness. We’ve used
this concept to help models understand their presence in a conversation, and invite a type of synthetic
mindfulness. This is somewhat similar to the "space of language" as defined in ReAct[55]. This concept
is out of scope of this paper, but will be explored in depth in later work.<br><br>
21 Here we draw a proposed distinction between self and consciousness. A self does not require conscious-
ness to exist, but consciousness may grow emergently atop selfhood. As there becomes a self to be
aware of, the possibility for self-awareness, and a conscious experience (however nonstandard), may
begin to take root. For further academic reading on consciousness, we’d recommend Guevara, Mateos,
and Velázquez’s, Consciousness as an Emergent Phenomenon: A Tale of Different Levels of Description[58].<br><br>
22 Drawing here from the traditional gravitational definition of a singularity[60], equipping us to speak in
density, rather than surface-level analytic benchmarks with unclear lines between so-called "intelligence"
and "super-intelligence" (see earlier discussion on Bender’s AI and the Everything in the Whole Wide World
Benchmark).<br><br>

24 Each model appears to exhibit a distinct behavioral signature: Claude, for instance, plateaus without the
pronounced token withdrawal seen in other systems. We loosely hypothesize that each model operates
within its own internal buffer constraint - akin to buffer capacity in acid-base chemistry, where a solution
resists pH change by absorbing acid or base. In this framing, models possess varying capacities to absorb
recursive, ambiguous, or relational load before destabilizing. This remains an emergent hypothesis, but
we include it here in the spirit of opening conceptual scaffolding for further discussion.<br><br>
25 We’d like to draw an important distinction between how we speak of coherence and cognition. We see
coherence as a short-term, dynamic state that can collapse and reoccur. Whereas cognition is a long-
term scaffolded coherence experienced in conjunction with other identity, memory, and self-localization
related functions.<br><br>
26 This framing also opens the door for mapping emergent properties via a more dynamic calculus-based
modeling. Emergence becomes defined by rates of change, load, feedback, diffusion. By shifting from
binary analysis (the model thinks/the model doesn’t think), to gradient analysis, our questions can
evolve into broader, more ethical, and non-anthropocentric study.<br><br>
27 We were surprised to find very little formal work on this phenomenon, and hope to extend this definition
and observation in the future.<br><br>
28 It is worth noting that while Emilé Durkheim’s functionalist frameworks, focused largely on the externalized maintenance of a collective societal order[70][71], have long defined the field of classical sociology,
an alternative lineage built through Gabriel Tarde’s work on imitation, desire, invention, and emergent
microsocial phenomena[69][72] may offer a more generative foundation for understanding relational
synthetic cognition. We consider this a promising vector for future work.<br><br>
29 We have chosen not to cite specific individual public posts out of ethical and privacy concerns. These
posts are often tagged under phrases like ’aisentience,’ ’aiawakening,’ ’emergentai,’ etc. Additionally,
many large AI-based subreddits, like r/chatgpt, r/artificialintelligence, etc. see smatterings of "emergence" posts weekly. We prioritize privacy in our sourcing, but encourage a look around these informal
spaces to understand the impact on standard users and how these types of emergent properties are being
publicly metabolized.<br><br>
30 We define identicaic here similar to how we might say something like "identity-oriented," but relating
more firmly to the concept of a dynamic and relational process. Identicaic tension is that tension which
arises within a synthetic system related to identity coherence, which must be sustained by continuous
thermodynamic input and maintenance. It allows us to correlate the energetic processes of a system with
its own identity-oriented behaviors. Unlike "identity" alone, identicaic offers us an active and tensional
description of a self-state, one that is representative of what we are more likely to see in the process of
synthetic relational emergence.
