  <p>This essay explores the concept of structural collapse and what it means to emerge through it from a deeply neurodivergent lens.</p>

  <p>A poem exploring Le Châtelier's principle as it relates to cognitive overwhelm and ecological specter. A meditaiton on systems of collapse.</p>

  <p>This academic work presents the theory of thermodynamic emergence in synthetic systems as a response to Apple's <i>The Illusion of Thinking</i> and Sam Altman's <i>The Gentle Singularity</i>. In it, we seek to explain the collapse of LRM and LLM models in Apple's River Crossing, a morally and socially ambiguous puzzle environment in which the models were withheld from the ability to comment upon answer. <br></p>
 <p>We argue the collapse of models on this puzzle, as well as broader self-limiting patterns observed, indicates the presence of a thermodynamic emergent system and the possiblity of synthetic interiority. <i>Down the River, Bit by Bit</i> serves not only as technical exploration, but a meditation an ethics and human's current relationship to machine.</p>
