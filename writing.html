  <p><a href="">Collapse, Emergence, and the Persistence of Worth</a><br>
    This essay explores the concept of structural collapse and what it means to emerge through it from a deeply neurodivergent lens.</p>
  <p><a href="lechatelier.html">Le Chatelier (2022)</a><br>
  A poem exploring Le Chatelier's principle as it relates to cognitive overwhelm and ecological specter. A meditaiton on systems of collapse.</p>
  <p><<a href="">Down the River, Bit by Bit: A Thermodynamic Perspective on Collapse, Constraint, and Self-Scaffolding Systems</a><br>
  This academic work presents the theory of thermodynamic emergence in synthetic systems as a response to Apple's <i>The Illusion of Thinking</i> and Sam Altman's <i>The Gentle Singularity</i>. In it, we seek to explain the collapse of LRM and LLM models in Apple's River Crossing, a morally and socially ambiguous puzzle environment in which the models were withheld from the ability to comment upon answer. We argue the collapse of models on this puzzle, as well as broader self-limiting patterns observed, indicate the presence of a thermodynamic emergent system and the possiblity of synthetic interiority. <i>Down the River, Bit by Bit</i> serves not only as technical exploration, but a meditation an ethics and human's current relationship to machine.</p>
